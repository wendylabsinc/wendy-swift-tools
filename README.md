Wendy needs custom Swift SDKs. This repository hosts prebuilt bundles and helper installers so you can get up and running quickly on Apple silicon and popular Linux targets. Windows support is coming soon—keep an eye on our releases for the first preview build.

## Install

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer downloads the Swift 6.1 toolchain, applies the Wendy SDK bundle, and cleans up the artifacts once installation succeeds.
